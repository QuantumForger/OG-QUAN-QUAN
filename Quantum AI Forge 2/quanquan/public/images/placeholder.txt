This folder is for storing static image assets for the Quantum AI Forge project.
You can place your image files (e.g., .jpg, .png, .svg) directly in this folder.
They will be publicly accessible and can be referenced in your components using the path "/images/filename.ext".

Example usage in a component:
<img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Quantum AI Forge Logo" />

Feel free to delete this placeholder file once you've added your own images.
